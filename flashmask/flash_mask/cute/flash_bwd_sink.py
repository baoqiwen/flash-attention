# Standalone cute-dsl reduction kernel for the learnable_sink gradient (dsink).
#
# Computes, for each query head h:
#     dsink[h] = -sum_{b,s} exp2(sink[h] * log2e - lse_log2[b, h, s]) * dpsum[b, h, s]
#
# where ``dpsum`` (== delta == rowsum(out * dout)) and ``lse_log2`` (== lse * log2e)
# are the fp32 workspaces already produced by the backward preprocess kernel
# (see flash_bwd_preprocess.py), both of shape (batch, num_head, seqlen_q_rounded).
# Padded rows (beyond seqlen_q) have dpsum == 0 written by the preprocess kernel
# (lse_log2 is 0.0 there, not +inf), so the product exp2(...) * dpsum == 0 and they
# contribute nothing -- no masking is required.
#
# One thread block handles one head, so there is no cross-block accumulation and the
# result is deterministic (no atomics).
