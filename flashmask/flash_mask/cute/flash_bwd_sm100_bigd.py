"""SM100 backward for head dims larger than 256 (supported and measured: 512/512).

Why a separate file from `flash_bwd_sm100.py`: that kernel hand-unrolls the
low|high halves of its split axes in ~8 places in the load warp, and hardcodes
`tile_m == tile_n == 128`. Two halves is not enough once head_dim exceeds 512
(576/2 = 288 exceeds the UMMA N limit of 256, so that shape needs 3 chunks), so
every one of those sites would have to become a loop, which puts the
already-working d256/d192 configs at risk. Here the chunk count and `cta_group`
are parameters from the start, so the axis splits into as many chunks as the
shape needs.

TMEM resource model (verified on B200, encoded in tmem_plan() / sm100_utils.tmem_cols):
an accumulator costs N * (rows_per_cta / 128) columns, so cta_group=2 with M=128 halves
the column cost. The one irregular case is cta_group=1 with M=64, which takes the
16-datapath lane interleave and still spans N columns.

Phase 1 (the only path that runs today): cta_group=1, no swapAB, all three of dV/dK/dQ
are produced per m-iteration and drained by the reduce warps into the fp32 gmem
accumulators. Correct but accum-traffic bound -- the drain is roughly 40% of the kernel,
split about evenly between its dQ and dKV halves (measurements in __init__, where the
drain cost model and the tile-size dependence are derived).

Operand reuse: every tile is read by two gemms in different orientations -- K by S and
dQ, Q by S and dK, dO by dP and dV -- and this used to re-TMA the tile for the second
one. The two orientations are the same bytes (derivation in _setup_smem_layout), so the
second gemm now reads whatever the first left in SMEM and _reuse_schedule decides per
access whether a fetch is needed at all, cutting the per-m-tile fetch count by about a
fifth at 512/512. The saving is TMA issue and mbarrier round trips on the load warp, not
HBM bytes: an n-block's K is re-read by all 64 query heads, so L2 was already serving
those fetches.

Phase 2 (later): cta_group=2 + swapAB on dV/dK so both stay resident in TMEM for
the whole m loop, dropping the accum traffic from once per m-iteration to once
per n-block. The cta_group=2 arithmetic is already threaded through (column rules,
n_block_pair skip derivation, MMA M constraints) but the path is NOT enabled and has
never run: `_launch` passes no `cluster=` to .launch() and does not round the grid to the
pair size, the kernel body still slices every MMA at `get_slice(0)` instead of the CTA's
own v coordinate, and gK / gV are tiled by their own n index rather than the PAIR's.

It was costed out and deliberately not taken. The short version: the TMEM column rules
leave only two legal (tile_m, tile_n) pairs that save anything, each halves ONE of the
two drain terms and leaves the other flat, and the better of the two is worth well under
a third of the drain. That variant is additionally blocked on the dQ gemm's A operand --
at cta_group=2 its K spans the pair's whole key range while the accumulator's M folds, so
each CTA needs dS for its own m half over BOTH CTAs' keys, and it only computed dS for
all m over its own keys. flash_bwd_sm100.py solves this with separate_sdS_buffers /
smem_dS_dq_block_view, but that machinery asserts tile_n <= mma_k (64), which the config
in question violates, so there is no working precedent in this repo to copy. A cluster of
(2,1) is also entirely consumed by the MMA's own v mode, so Q / dO^T are NOT multicast
(see flash_bwd_sm100.py:1005) and there is no operand-traffic win to add on top. See the
git history of this docstring for the per-config numbers.

      Accumulator slicing -- a chunk width that admits no legal slice (see
      accum_slice_candidates) is rejected here rather than left to blow up in the

    Ranking is MEASURED, not modelled. `flush/work` (accumulator traffic per unit of
    work) used to be the primary key; the kernel turned out to sit far below both HBM
    bandwidth and MMA peak, i.e. bound by latency rather than traffic, so
    that model does not describe the bottleneck. What the 512/512 sweep
    (b=16 s=4096 h=16) actually showed:

      dv_chunk == tile_n is a sweet spot, not "wider is better": narrowing dv below
        tile_n costs progressively more, and dv 256 (which forces d_chunk 32) is the
        worst config measured. dv_chunk is the dV gemm's N; away from tile_n it either
        adds MMA rounds or starves the output scratch.
      At equal SMEM, a wider d_chunk wins: d128 beat d64.

    Hence the key: |dv_chunk - tile_n|, then d_chunk, then flush/work, then the LOWER
    K residency.

    That last key looks backwards -- more resident K chunks ought to help the S and dQ
    gemms -- but it is what keeps the ranking on measured ground: the sweep that produced
    the numbers above ran at d_chunks_resident=2, and nothing has measured what the
    leftover SMEM is worth as extra residency. That leftover is real (the accumulator
    staging buffer this model used to charge for is gone), so residency is the obvious
    next knob to sweep; until then the solver does not spend it on a guess.

# why dQ_reduce_ncol has to come with the wider d_chunk -- d_chunk is the tile the drain
# slices, so a 64-column slice is only legal once the chunk is at least 64 wide.
# 576/512 (same host and mask): the solver picks d_chunk 96, which is the worst width this
# axis can take -- gcd(96, dv_chunk 128) is 32, so the whole drain drops to 32-column slices
# (roughly double the count) and the axis splits into 6 chunks. 576 = 2**6 * 9, so of the
# legal widths (32/96/192/576) only 192 divides 64: it is the only way to get the 64-column
# slice back, and it measured substantially faster despite doing slightly more math.
# The price, and the thing this pin is measuring: a 192-wide output chunk leaves
# (512-256)/192 = 1 TMEM out slot instead of 2, so the output gemms no longer overlap the
# drain, and 2x192 K stages do not fit in SMEM so K is single-buffered.
