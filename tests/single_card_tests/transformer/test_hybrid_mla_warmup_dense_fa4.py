"""The full-causal phases run as dense FA4, and refuse to run as anything else.

Phase 1 (``hybrid_mla_attention="mqa_full_causal"``) and phase 2
(``"mqa_dsa"`` + ``dsa_indexer_use_sparse_loss=False``) both attend over the
*whole* per-document causal span. Expressing that span as an explicit
``[b, s, s]`` column table for the FlashMLA sparse kernel costs ``O(s^2)`` memory
for no benefit: measured net allocation for the table alone is 1.6 GiB at s=8192,
25.0 GiB at s=32768 and 100.0 GiB at s=65536 (against 3.3 / 13.0 / 26.0 GiB for a
dense forward *and* backward), and past s=46336 the sparse kernel's own
``(b*s-1)*topk_padded`` index arithmetic overflows int32 -- which does *not*
reliably crash: s=46337 returns finite but wrong numbers for its last 55 rows.
So ``MQALatentAttention._dense_attn`` hands the same softmax to FA4's dense
flashmask instead, keeping the document structure in the caller's own
``startend_row_indices`` -- and ``_assert_dense_fa4`` raises rather than
substituting the table when FA4 is not what the environment resolves to.

What is pinned here:

* ``TestBackendSelection`` -- the dense path is taken whenever it can be, and
  every way of not resolving to FA4 raises instead of degrading. Phase 1 shares
  ``_forward_full_causal`` with the warmup's attention half, so both are covered
  by one selection point; phase 3, which genuinely selects 640 columns, keeps
  ``_sparse_attn`` and is *not* subject to the assertion.
* ``TestCpRowBounds`` -- context parallelism keeps the dense path, which needs
  the causal diagonal expressed as an explicit flashmask bound in this rank's
  row space instead of the kernel's own bottom-right-aligned one.
* ``TestDenseWarmupPrecision`` -- the numerical case. Both backends are compared
  against the same fp32 eager reference, and the sparse path is used as the
  *yardstick*: replacing it is only legitimate if dense is at least as close to
  fp32 as sparse is, forward and backward. No hand-picked tolerance decides the
  verdict. Since production has no sparse full-causal path any more, the
  yardstick is built here, by feeding ``_sparse_attn`` the explicit table from
  ``hybrid_mla_utils._full_causal_indices``.
* ``TestDenseWarmupPadRows`` -- a pad row is a query row with *every* column
  masked, which is a softmax-over-nothing hazard the sparse path avoids
  structurally (all ``-1`` columns). FA4 returns exact zeros there instead of
  NaN; that is a kernel property, so it needs a regression test.
* ``TestFrozenInputs`` -- ``train_indexer_only`` freezes the backbone and can
  freeze ``softmax_offset``, and a ``PyLayer`` whose input has
  ``stop_gradient=True`` must get ``None`` back at that position, which
  ``flashmask_attention`` does not do. ``_dense_pylayer_inputs`` works around
  it, for the sink and for a frozen q/k/v alike; the workaround must be
  forward-neutral.

``FLAGS_flash_attn_version`` is process-global and a bare pytest process never
constructs ``TrainingArguments``, so it keeps the image default 2. Production on
this SM100 box gets 4 from ``training_args.py:1764-1780``. Every case that runs a
full-causal forward therefore has to pin it with
``hybrid_mla_utils._flash_attn_version(4)`` -- without that the forward now
raises rather than quietly taking a second backend.
